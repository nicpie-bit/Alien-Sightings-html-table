# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

One problem... We have to much data to search through manually! That's why I am here. I wrote code that will create a table dynamically. I also needed to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values.

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

* I created a basic HTML web page.

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, I wrote code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* I used a date form in my HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)

* Building off of level 1 I will now create a form that will allow our followers to search through the data using specific criteria.

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, I wrote JavaScript code so the user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
